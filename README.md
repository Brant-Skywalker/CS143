# CS143: Compilers

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of Stanford
[*CS143: Compilers*](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/). If you find any errors, please
email me at siyuanq4@illinois.edu.

### Important Information

Unfortunately, I'm not a Stanford student! :wink: Assignments are marked completed only after the *entire* test scripts have been
passed, unless otherwise stated.
