# CS143: Compilers

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of Stanford
[*CS143: Compilers*](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/). If you find any errors, please
email me at siyuanq4@illinois.edu.

### Important Information

Unfortunately, I'm not a Stanford student! :wink: Assignments are marked completed only after the *entire* test scripts have been
passed, unless otherwise stated.

### :warning: WARNING :warning:

If you are required to write your own implementation without any unauthorized assistance, e.g. you are a Stanford student currently taking this course, please do not read any of the code in this repository. This is academic integrity infringement, which is unacceptable under any circumstances.
